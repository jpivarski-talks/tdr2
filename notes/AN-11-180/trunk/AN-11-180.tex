% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been

% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.
\abstract{
The identification of jets containing the weak decay of a B-hadron is
an essential tool for a wide range of analyses in the context of the
Standard Model and beyond. A variety of algorithms exploit the long
lifetime and the presence of soft leptons to discriminate these jets
from those associated to light quarks. The status of the b-tagging
tools and their commissioning with 2011 data is presented. New
developments and improvements of the b-tagging algorithms are also
documented.

% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible. For APS submissions, they are automatically converted to APS keywords.
