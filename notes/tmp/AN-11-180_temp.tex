%%%%%%%%%%%%% ptdr definitions %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\input{ptdr-definitions} %These have been replaced by the equivalent style file
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Title page %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\cmsNoteHeader{AN-11-180} % This is over-written in the CMS environment: useful as preprint no. for export versions
% >> Title: please make sure that the non-TeX equivalent is in PDFTitle below
\title{Status of b-tagging tools for 2011 data analysis}

% >> Authors
%Author is always "The CMS Collaboration" for PAS and papers, so author, etc, below will be ignored in those cases
%For multiple affiliations, create an address entry for the combination
\address[neu]{University on the Moon}
\author[cern]{The CMS Collaboration}

% >> Date
% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been
% redefined to match, but if the date needs to be fixed, please write it in this fashion.
% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.
\date{\today}

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.
\abstract{
The identification of jets containing the weak decay of a B-hadron is
an essential tool for a wide range of analyses in the context of the
Standard Model and beyond. A variety of algorithms exploit the long
lifetime and the presence of soft leptons to discriminate these jets
from those associated to light quarks. The status of the b-tagging
tools and their commissioning with 2011 data is presented. New
developments and improvements of the b-tagging algorithms are also
documented.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible. For APS submissions, they are automatically converted to APS keywords.
\hypersetup{%
pdfauthor={Alexander Schmidt},%
pdftitle={Status of b-tagging tools for 2011 data analysis},%
pdfsubject={CMS},%
pdfkeywords={CMS, BTV, physics, software}}

%% **DO NOT REMOVE THE BIBLIOGRAPHY** which is located before the appendix.
%% You can take the text between here and the bibiliography as an example which you should replace with the actual text of your document.
%% If you include other TeX files, be sure to use "\input{filename}" rather than "\input filename".
%% The latter works for you, but our parser looks for the braces and will break when uploading the document.
