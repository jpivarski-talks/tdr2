% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %** to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros** in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.
\abstract{We present an inclusive, signature-based search for groups
  of collimated muons, arising from spectroscopic cascades in a hidden
  sector accessible only through high-energy collisions, using the CMS
  detector.  In several signatures defined by number of muons per
  collimated group and number of groups per event, we searched for the
  lightest on-shell state in the hidden spectrum with a mass-peak fit and set
  limits on $\sigma\mathcal{B}\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the model
  acceptance of the signature. With no excess of data events compared to 
  the expectation, production rate for the new resonances within the 
  experimental acceptance is ruled out at the level of  $0.1$--$0.5$~pb 
  at 95\% C.L. depending of the signature and the mass of the new lightest 
  state wthin $0.25 < m < 5$ GeV/c$^2$.  We also set $\sigma\mathcal{B}$ limits 
  on two representative benchmark scenarios for SUSY with a hidden dark  
  sector and the NMSSM Higgs production in the channel $h_1 \to a_1 a_1 \to 4 \mu$.}
