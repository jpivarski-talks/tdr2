\abstract{
A signature-based search for groups of collimated muons (muon jets) is performed using 35 pb$^{-1}$ of
data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV.  The analysis aims to search for production of new low-mass states decaying into pairs of muons, and is designed to achieve high sensitivity to a broad range of models predicting muon jet signatures. With no excess observed in the data over the background expectation, 
upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio times acceptance are derived for several event topologies and range from 0.1-0.5~pb. in addition, the results are interpreted for several benchmark models in the context of SUSY with a new light dark sector yielding limits on new physics production exceeding the Tevatron reach.
