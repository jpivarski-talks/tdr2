\section{Conclusions}
A signature-based search for groups of collimated muons (muon jets) in the first 35 pb$^{-1}$ of
the LHC data collected by the CMS experiment has revealed no signals of new physics within the
sensitivity of the measurement. We found zero events consistent with two or more decays of the
predicted new light boson species to a pair of muons in the same event, and no excess over the
SM backgrounds for production of single high-$p_T$ bosons decaying to pair of muons. Relaxing 
the assumption that the light bosons are on-shell and searching for possible $a_2 \to a_1 a_1 \to 4\mu$ 
cascades revealed one event, consistent with the background expectation. 

With these observations, we set limits on the production of new low-mass states
decaying to pairs of muons that can be applied to a broad class of models predicting
the lepton jet signatures. These limits exclude production of new physics in several event 
topologies with 95\% C.L.\ limits on $\sigma \times \mathcal{B} \times
\alpha_{\mbox{\scriptsize gen}}$ in the range of 0.1--0.5~pb.

We also set model-dependent limits on several benchmark models predicting production of the new
light states in the context of Dark SUSY, which significantly extend the reach of the Tevatron analyses
to these kind of signatures. In the context of the NMSSM Higgs search in the channel $h \to a_1 a_1 \to 4 \mu$
with $m(a_1)<2m_{\tau}$, the LHC senstivitity will surpass that of the Tevatron experiments with 100~pb$^{-1}$ of
data and will significantly constrain the allowed NMSSM parameter space with 1~fb$^{-1}$ of data.
