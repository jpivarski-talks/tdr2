This paper describes algorithms to align the CMS muon system with
tracks and the results of those algorithms using beam-halo muons from
the 2008 LHC circulating beam tests and cosmic ray muons from the 2008
Cosmic Run at Four Tesla (CRAFT) exercise.  We provide a theoretical
description of each algorithm, results of simulations, and
cross-checks of the results with real data. \\
