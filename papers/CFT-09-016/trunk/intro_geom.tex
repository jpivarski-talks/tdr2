The CMS experiment~\cite{ref:cms} features a large muon tracking system for
identifying muons and reconstructing their momenta.  As with all
tracking systems, the momentum resolution of reconstructed tracks depends both
on the intrinsic position resolution of its detector elements and on their
alignment.  By ``alignment,'' we mean measurement of the detector
elements' positions and orientations in space, 3 translational plus 3
rotational degrees of freedom, knowledge which allows us to transform
hit positions from detector-bound local coordinate systems into a
common coordinate system for all CMS tracking systems.

This paper describes methods for aligning barrel Drift Tube (DT)
chambers and endcap Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) and their internal
layers with tracks, as well as results of alignments using cosmic rays
from the 2008 Cosmic Run at Four Tesla (CRAFT) exercise
and beam-halo tracks from the 2008 LHC injection.  We will consider two
cases: (1) alignment relative to the modular structures from which the
muon system is built, and (2) alignment in a single coordinate system
defined by the central CMS tracker.  Alignment using integrated
physical measurement devices such as lasers, rulers, and
inclinometers is described elsewhere~\cite{ref:hardware_alignment}, as
are the details of the data transfer and computing model which is used
to implement these algorithms~\cite{ref:workflow}.

The scale of desired alignment precision is given by the intrinsic
resolution of the chambers: 100--300~$\mu$m.  Since alignment errors
and measurement errors add in quadrature, misalignment becomes
irrelevant once it is significantly below the intrinsic hit
resolution.

\subsection{Geometry of the muon system}

The muon system is a collection of independent tracking chambers, each
of which contains parallel measurement planes, here called chamber
layers.  The chambers are mounted on 5 moveable barrel wheels (labeled
$-$2 through $+$2) and 6 endcap disks (3 per endcap).  Within these
large structures, chambers are arranged in stations, labeled in
Figure~\ref{fig:muon_system_labeled}, with azimuthal positions called
sectors (in the barrel) or simply chamber number (in the endcap),
labeled in Figure~\ref{fig:muoneverything}.  Barrel stations 1--3 have
12 sectors, station 4 has 14 sectors, and most rings of chambers in
the endcap have 36 chambers, the exceptions being ME2/1, ME3/1, and
ME4/1, which have 18.

Barrel DT chambers have internal structure: superlayers
containing 4 layers each.  Stations 1--3 have 3 superlayers, the
middle one measuring a direction orthogonal to the outer
two.  Station 4 chambers have no middle superlayer (only superlayers~1
and 3).  Endcap CSCs contain 6 identical layers, each of which
measures both coordinates with intersecting cathode strips and anode
wires.

\subsection{Coordinate systems and conventions}

The Alignment Integration Frame, a coordinate system in which all
tracking systems are to be aligned, is defined by the tracker.  The
origin of this system is the center of mass of the tracker's detector
elements~\cite{ref:tracker_alignment}, close to the LHC interaction
point, and oriented such that the $+z$ axis points roughly along the
beamline, to the west.  The $+y$ axis points vertically upward, with
$+x$ forming a right-handed coordinate system by pointing
south~\cite{ref:twikiCMSConventions}.  These same coordinates can be
expressed cylindrically, with $x$ and $y$ replaced by $r = \sqrt{x^2 +
y^2}$ and $\phi = \tan^{-1}(y/x)$ with $\phi=0$ pointing along the
$+x$ axis.  The curvilinear coordinate $r\phi$ is perpendicular to the
beamline and to rays from the beamline, and differentials of $r\phi$
are understood to vary in $\phi$, not $r$ (so $d(r\phi)$ is equivalent
to $r \, d\phi$).

Each muon chamber and layer has its own local coordinate system,
centered on the subdetector with local $z$ being perpendicular to the
measurement planes, and $+z$ points in the direction of decreasing
layer number.  The local $x$ axis roughly corresponds to global
$r\phi$ (though for some chambers the direction is reversed), and
local $y$ forms a right-handed coordinate system.  In the absence of
misalignment, $y$ is parallel to the beamline for DT chambers and
radial for CSCs.

Layer/superlayer coordinate systems differ slightly from their parent
chambers.  The origin of each coordinate system is centered such that
$z=0$ lies on the layer and the average of layers in the superlayer, and
both layers and superlayers have small offsets in $x$ as well.  The
middle superlayer of DT chambers (superlayer~2) are rotated by 90$^\circ$ with
respect to the chamber coordinates, such that $x$ measurements in
these layers are $y$ positions in chamber coordinates.  Internal
alignments of layers introduce additional corrections.

Cathode strips in CSC layers fan radially from the beamline,
intersected by anode wires.  The strips measure a coordinate
perpendicular to their orientation, which in the absence of
misalignment coincides with global $r\phi$ throughout the chamber.  We
find ``local $r\phi$,'' or local $x$ times the cosine of the angle
between the strip and $+y$, to be a more convenient coordinate than
$x$ for CSCs.  This is because local $r\phi$ is determined purely by
high-precision strip measurements, avoiding input from the groups of
ganged wires which would introduce a complicated and large-scale (cm)
granularity to the residuals distributions.

We describe the orientations of chambers and layers with $\phi_x$,
$\phi_y$, and $\phi_z$, where each is a right-hand rotation around the
corresponding coordinate axis.  The 3-D rotation is the following
composition:
\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{c c c}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \cos\phi_x & \sin\phi_x \\
0 & -\sin\phi_x & \cos\phi_x
\end{array}\right) \cdot 
\left(\begin{array}{c c c}
\cos\phi_y & 0 & -\sin\phi_y \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
\sin\phi_y & 0 & \cos\phi_y
\end{array}\right) \cdot
\left(\begin{array}{c c c}
\cos\phi_z & \sin\phi_z & 0 \\
-\sin\phi_z & \cos\phi_z & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right)\mbox{.}
\end{equation}
