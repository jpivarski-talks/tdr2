Page 7, first paragraph of section 3.2: "mis-match" should be
"mismatch".  In our version, the word is split at the page boundary
("mis-" at the end of one line and "match" at the beginning of the
next), but in the JINST proof, the word appears in the middle of a
line.

Title of section 5.1.2 (table of contents and page 15): the word
"Ansatz" should be capitalized, to be consistent with other uses
(three on page 14).  (Other words in section titles can be lower-case,
according to JINST style).

Equation 5.4: both summations are over index "i".  The second one (sum
over tracks) should have index "j".  All other subscripts in this
equation are correct.
