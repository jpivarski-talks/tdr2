The focus of the paper is on the results obtained, but for each
result, the method and its sensitivity must be described.  The paper
follows this organizational pattern: method, sensitivity,
results/cross-checks.  In all instances where external references
could be cited to describe parts of a procedure, it was.

> Introduction
> wheel appears for the first time in the caption of Figure 2 and is
> not defined in the text of the body.

Just before the first reference to Figure 2, "wheel" and "disk" are
now introduced:

"Three technologies are employed: Drift Tube (DT) chambers on the five
modular wheels of the barrel section, Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) on
the six endcap disks (illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2) and Resistive
Plate Chambers (RPC) throughout."

> Fifth paragraph : the three procedures are not complementary, for
> example (a) do not complete (b).

Removed (now "three alignment procedures").

> Section 2
> Section 2, page 3 : "local rphi" to be replaced with "local r"
> (2 times)

No, "local rphi" is intended.

> Figure 3 (a) and (b) are unreadable when printed

They have been redrawn in a simpler style that should be more
correctly printed.

> Typical measurement precision of chambers should be given

They are given in the introduction, paragraph 4 (100-300 microns).

> Section 3.1
> First sentence should be re-written.  It is the track parameters
> that are affected by energy loss.  A track remains a track, it does
> not lose precision

Rewritten as

"Measured trajectories within a single chamber do not suffer
from uncertainties due to scattering in the steel between
chambers. Segments, determined from linear fits to hits in one chamber
only, are therefore used to determine the alignment of layers inside
the chamber."

> fourth paragraph : replace "a vector" with "is a vector"

Done

> fourth paragraph : replace "a 1x6 matrix" with "is a 1x6 matrix"

Done

> Track-segments and residuals are not defined

Definitions in section 2 are now more explicit:

"Residuals are differences between the predicted particle trajectories
and the muon chamber data."

"Within this common frame, the positions of hits from different layers
can be related to each other and combined by a linear fit into segments
with position (x, y) and direction (dx/dz, dy/dz)."

> use "Track-segment" or "Track segment" through the whole text but
> not both

> idem for "Track-segment" and "Segment"

Hyphens are only used when the noun "track" is being used as an
adverb, for example "track-segment parameters".  To simplify this,
though, we followed your second suggestion and replaced all
instances of "track-segment" with "segment" except in the
introduction, before "segment" (by itself) is defined.

> lat paragraph : replace "matrix inversion" by "matrix inversion

Done

> Given the angular distribution of cosmic-ray tracks, not all

> the case?

The precision varies with 1/sqrt(N) where N is the number of muons
used in the layer alignment, but the geometric acceptance is not as
steep a function of incidence angle in the layer alignment case, since
they are not required to intersect the tracker.

> "Typical (RMS) corrections" : they are RMS of the corrections
> distributions and are not "typical"

"(RMS)" was intended to define "typical", but it has been rewritten as
"The RMS of the corrections is..."

> Corrections themselves should also be presented as they provide an
> indication of the initial geometry after detector installation

It is the corrections themselves whose RMS is given.  This expresses
the scale of installation accuracy (100 microns, tens of microrad).

> Results should be discussed.  They are presented in one single
> sentence after a page describing the method.

Section 3.2 is in part a study of the alignment obtained in section
3.1.  Added "... and will be studied in more detail in the next
section."

> Section 3.2
> Line 4 : "The deviations" from what?

Rewritten as

"The four hits in each superlayer define a superlayer segment with a
one-dimensional position and slope, and segments from different
superlayers must match at a common plane. Segment residuals, Delta
x_S, are the mismatch of these superlayer segments, and are sensitive
to relative positions of the superlayers as well as their internal
layer alignment parameters."

> "Segment residual" is not defined.

The definition has been made more explicit in the above.

> Figure 4 (a) : 'after' and 'before' are too short as labels
> (alignemnt of something similar should be added).  Mean and sigma of
> the distribution after alignment should be given.

"After" and "before" in all plots have been made more explicit and
standardized across all plots.  Mean and sigma after alignment has
been added to this figure.

Rewritten as

"After layer alignment, segment positions and angles are more
consistent between superlayers 1 and 3, leading to better matching at
the common plane."

Rewritten to be more explicit:

"photogrammetry measurements P_x, P_z, and P_phiy of the relative
superlayer positions."

For each chamber, there is one photogrammetry measurement of the
displacement between superlayers 1 and 3.

Rewrote "track-based measurements" -> "segment measurements"

Rewritten as

"Although CSC chamber alignment using overlap tracks and alignment
with tracks from the tracker (described in the next section) both
determine the relative positions of CSC chambers, the overlap method
has two advantages: (1) it achieves high precision with a small number
of tracks, and (2) it is less prone to potential systematic errors in
tracking. Since the two methods use different datasets in different
ways, comparison between them can be used to diagnose systematic
errors in tracks from the tracker or in their propagation to the muon
endcaps."

> Section 4.1
> First paragraph:
>     - replace "is to fit" by "is to match"

These are segment fits, so "fit" is appropriate.  Removed "pairs of"
so that it now says, "to fit segments from the same muon in each of
the overlapping chambers independently"

>     - replace "the same muon" by "the same muon track"

The important aspect is that both segments were made by the same
physical muon, and therefore we should expect them to be collinear.

This is true: we fit segments independently and require all chambers
in the ring to be mutually consistent with their neighbors.

> Why twists of the CSC rings are avoided?  The whole CSC rings cannot

The Lagrange multipliers remove unmeasurable degrees of freedom, flat
directions in chi^2 space.  Just as an overall translation or rotation
of the ring cannot be determined from relative positions of chambers,
a distortion in which all chambers rotate by the same amount in phi_y
cannot be determined by comparing segment slopes.  Such a distortion
would rotate the apparent momentum vector of all muons in a way that
is consistent between neighboring pairs of chambers.

It is necessary to fix these degrees of freedom for two reasons: we
wouldn't want unconstrained degrees of freedom to grow unchecked, and
leaving them unconstrained would make the matrix in the formalism
singular, anyway.

> Section 4.2
> By how much was the miss-aligned the simulation?

Added that information to the text:

"From an initially misaligned detector, the procedure aligned
\delta_{phiy} with 1.04 mrad accuracy (initially 2 mrad),
\delta_{rphi} with 230 micron (initially 1000 micron), and
\delta_{phiz} with 0.25 mrad (initially 1 mrad), determined from the
RMS of differences between the aligned positions and the true
positions of the chambers."

> The procedure does not "re-aligned \delta_phi".

Addressed in the re-write above.

> Section 4.3
> Third paragraph : replace "which transforms to a 210 micron, 0.23

Rewrote "The RMS of the aligned distributions" -> "The RMS of these
distributions after alignment"

Added

> Fourth paragraph : Are the photogrammetry errors Gaussian
> distributed?  if not they cannot be "subtracted in quadrature"

The photogrammetry errors only need to be approximately Gaussian for
an estimate of the uncertainty.  Added "approximately" to the
conclusion:

"Subtracting the photogrammetry errors in quadrature, one can conclude
that the track-based measurement has approximately 270~$\mu$m and
0.35~mrad uncertainties, in rough agreement with the prediction from
simulation."

Clarified:

"To avoid domination of the fit by a few of the most linear segments,
which are not necessarily from the best-determined tracks (unscattered
muons), segments with the largest 1% of weights have been excluded."

Done:

"In addition, the fits for four nearly horizontal chambers (in wheel,
station, sector (-1, 2, 8), (+1, 3, 8), (-1, 1, 12), and (+1, 2, 2))
failed to converge, all for reasons related to the scarcity of
horizontal cosmic ray muons."

Replaced with "in the minimization".

This is a typesetting issue which will change when the document is
reformatted.

> Section 5.4

It was a statement about the distribution of cosmic rays.  Rephrased:

"However, most cosmic rays fall on the barrel, in which chambers do
not overlap one another (with the exception of several chambers in
station 4)."

> Figure 10 : The mean values of the 'aligned' distributions do not
> seem to be compatible with 0.  Can this fact (if true) be commented?

They're consistent with zero: the significance, | mean |/( RMS/sqrt(N) )
= 0.32 (\delta_x), 0.86 (\delta_y), 1.66 (\delta_z), 1.95
(\delta_{phix}), 0.29 (\delta_{\phiy}), 1.03 (\delta_{phiz}).

> Section 5.5
> Table 5 : Why is the Gaussian width of the aligned combined fit
> smaller than the Tracker-only one?

The combined fits use more hits than the tracker-only fits, so in
principle the combined fits should be more precise than the
tracker-only fits.  That said, the differences between the two are not
significant, and in fact the Gaussian width of the combined fit is
smaller while the RMS is larger.  The number of (pT > 200 GeV) muons
is small, and the RMS is more susceptible to events in the tail than
the Gaussian width.  The validation sample is independent of the
alignment sample, so the RMS may have fluctuated upward.

This section presents new information relevant to the alignment of the
CMS muon system: sensitivity to the tails (Table 6).

> Summary and Discussion
> First paragraph, last sentence should be re-phrased.  IT is not from
> "independent" data that the 80 micron rphi resolution in DT chambers

The 80 microns number came from a comparison of track segments and
photogrammetry, which are independent.

> First paragraph, last sentence : the chamber positions do not have a
> "resolution".  It is their positions which are known with a
> precision of X mm.

Reworded to

"the DT chamber positions along the tracks are known with an accuracy
between 200 and 700 microns (stations 1–3, wheels −1, 0, +1)."

> Second paragraph, first sentence : may come before the last sentence
> of paragraph one where results of the paper are summarized.

All three paragraphs summarize the results of the paper, but the "new
techniques" of paragraph 2 is a different topic from the alignment
point resolutions of paragraph 1.

> Second paragraph, last sentence : what is meant by that sentence?
> why "suggests"?

Reworded to

"Non-Gaussianity in the physics of track propagation through the steel
yoke implies a non-linear extension to the general alignment method."

> References
